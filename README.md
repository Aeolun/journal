# Journal
A super basic personal journal.

I needed something that would allow me to write down my thoughts about the day with a minimum of fuzz, and since I couldn't find anything simple enough. I built it.

Feel free to use or extend it as you want, pull requests are welcome, but the idea is that it's as simple as possible both code and feature wise.
